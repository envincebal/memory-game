To view app, download the files to your desktop and open index.html. Otherwise click [HERE](https://envincebal.github.io/memory-game/).

## How to play

Choose a difficulty level, Easy or Hard. Player clicks on two cards to see if their icons match. If not, they return to hidden. Once all cards are uncovered and matched, the game ends. Player must find all matches before time or stars run out. The fewer turns you make at the end, the more stars you receive!
