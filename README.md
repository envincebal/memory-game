# Memory Game Project

To view app, download the files to your desktop and open index.html. Otherwise click [HERE](https://envincebal.github.io/memory-game/).

## Instructions to complete project

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

## How to play

Player clicks on two cards to see if their icons match. If not, they return to hidden. Once all cards are uncovered and matched, the game ends. Test your speed and race against the clock! The fewer turns you make at the end, the more stars you receive!
